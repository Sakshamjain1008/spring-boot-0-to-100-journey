# Module 2 – Spring Boot MVC and RESTful APIs

This module focuses on building robust RESTful web services using Spring Boot and understanding the complete Spring MVC architecture.

It covers how client requests are handled through controllers, processed using service-layer business logic, persisted using JPA repositories, and returned as clean API responses.

---

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Spring Boot MVC architecture  
- Dispatcher Servlet and embedded Tomcat workflow  
- Presentation layer using Controllers and DTOs  
- Persistence layer with Spring Data JPA repositories  
- Service layer for business logic implementation  
- RESTful mappings for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE  
- Input validation using annotations and custom validators  
- Global exception handling in Spring Boot  
- Transforming and structuring API responses  
- Java 8 Lambda expressions and Stream API  

---

## Architecture Concepts Learned

- Layered backend architecture:
  - Controller Layer (API endpoints)
  - Service Layer (business logic)
  - Repository Layer (database operations)
- DTO pattern for clean API design  
- Separation of concerns for scalable applications  

---

## Hands-on Implementations

- RESTful CRUD APIs  
- Request mapping with path variables and request bodies  
- Validation handling with meaningful error responses  
- Exception handling using controller advice  
- API response transformation techniques  

---

## Key Learnings

- How Spring MVC processes HTTP requests internally  
- Designing clean and maintainable REST APIs  
- Implementing layered backend architecture  
- Handling validations and errors professionally  
- Structuring backend code for real-world applications
